## Introduction

This page contains a list of all the currently available functions for the Rust Testing Framework, specifically the ones that the `BlockchainStateWrapper` type provides.  

Note: You will notice that most functions use the `num_bigint::BigUint` type for numbers. This is NOT the same as the BigUint type you use inside smart contracts. It comes from a Rust library, and they are different types. It is recommended to always use the Rust version outside of lambda functions, and only use the managed type when interacting with the sc directly.

## State-checking functions

These functions check the blockchain state. They will panic and the test will fail if the check is unsuccessful.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### check_egld_balance
```rust
check_egld_balance(&self, address: &Address, expected_balance: &num_bigint::BigUint)
```

Checks the EGLD balance for the given address.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### check_esdt_balance
```rust
check_esdt_balance(&self, address: &Address, token_id: &[u8], expected_balance: &num_bigint::BigUint)
```

Checks the fungible ESDT balance for the given address.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### check_nft_balance
```rust
check_nft_balance<T>(&self, address: &Address, token_id: &[u8], nonce: u64, expected_balance: &num_bigint::BigUint, opt_expected_attributes: Option<&T>)
```

Where T has to implement TopEncode, TopDecode, PartialEq, and core::fmt::Debug. This is usually done through `#[derive(TopEncode, TopDecode, PartialEq, Debug)]`. 

This function checks the NFT balance for a specific nonce for an address, and optionally checks the NFT attributes as well. If you are only interested in the balance, pass `Option::None` for `opt_expected_attributes`. The Rust compiler might complain that it can't deduce the generic `T`, in which case, you can do one of the following:

```rust
b_mock.check_nft_balance::<Empty>(..., None);

b_mock.check_nft_balance(..., Option::<Empty>::None);
```

Where `...` are the rest of the arguments.

## State-getter functions

These functions get the current state. They are generally used after a transaction to check that the tokens reached their intended destination. Most functions will panic if they're given an invalid address as argument.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### get_egld_balance
```rust
get_egld_balance(&self, address: &Address) -> num_bigint::BigUint
```

Gets the EGLD balance for the given account.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### get_esdt_balance
```rust
get_esdt_balance(&self, address: &Address, token_id: &[u8], token_nonce: u64) -> num_bigint::BigUint
```

Gets the ESDT balance for the given account. If you're interested in fungible token balance, set `token_nonce` to 0.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### get_nft_attributes
```rust
get_nft_attributes<T: TopDecode>(&self, address: &Address, token_id: &[u8], token_nonce: u64) -> Option<T>
```

Gets the NFT attributes for a token owned by the given address. Will return `Option::None` if there are no attributes.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### dump_state
```rust
dump_state(&self)
```

Prints the current state to console. Useful for debugging.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### dump_state_for_account_hex_attributes
```rust
dump_state_for_account_hex_attributes(&self, address: &Address)
```

Similar to the function before, but dumps state only for the given account.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### dump_state_for_account
```rust
dump_state_for_account<AttributesType: TopDecode + core::fmt::Debug>(&self, address: &Address)
```

Similar to the function before, but prints the attributes in a user-friendly format, given by the generic type given. This is useful for debugging NFT attributes.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

## State-altering functions

These functions alter the state in some way.   

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### create_user_account
```rust
create_user_account(&mut self, egld_balance: &num_bigint::BigUint) -> Address
```

Creates a new user account, with the given EGLD balance. The Address is pseudo-randomly generated by the framework.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### create_user_account_fixed_address
```rust
create_user_account_fixed_address(&mut self, address: &Address, egld_balance: &num_bigint::BigUint)
```

Same as the function above, but it lets you create an account with a fixed address, for the few cases when it's needed.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### create_sc_account
```rust
create_sc_account<CB, ContractObjBuilder>(&mut self, egld_balance: &num_bigint::BigUint, owner: Option<&Address>, obj_builder: ContractObjBuilder, contract_wasm_path: &str) -> ContractObjWrapper<CB, ContractObjBuilder>
```

Where: 
```rust
    CB: ContractBase<Api = DebugApi> + CallableContract + 'static,
    ContractObjBuilder: 'static + Copy + Fn() -> CB,
```

Creates a smart contract account. For `obj_builder`, you will have to pass `sc_namespace::contract_obj`. This function will return a `ContractObjWrapper`, which contains the address of the newly created SC, and the function that is used to create instances of your contract.  

The `ContractObjWrapper` will be used whenever you interact with the SC, which will be through the execution functions. If you only need the address (for setting balance, for example), you can use the `address_ref` method to get a reference to the stored address.  

`contract_wasm_path` is the path towards the wasm file. This path is relative to the `tests` folder that the current test file resides in. The most usual path will be `ouput/wasm_file_name.wasm`.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### create_sc_account_fixed_address
```rust
create_sc_account_fixed_address<CB, ContractObjBuilder>(&mut self, address: &Address, egld_balance: &num_bigint::BigUint, owner: Option<&Address>, obj_builder: ContractObjBuilder, contract_wasm_path: &str) -> ContractObjWrapper<CB, ContractObjBuilder>
```

Same as the function above, but the address can be set by the caller instead of being randomly generated.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### set_egld_balance
```rust
set_egld_balance(&mut self, address: &Address, balance: &num_bigint::BigUint)
```

Sets the EGLD balance for the given account.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### set_esdt_balance
```rust
set_esdt_balance(&mut self, address: &Address, token_id: &[u8], balance: &num_bigint::BigUint)
```

Sets the fungible token balance for the given account.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### set_nft_balance
```rust
set_nft_balance<T: TopEncode>(&mut self, address: &Address, token_id: &[u8], nonce: u64, balance: &num_bigint::BigUint, attributes: &T)
```

Sets the non-fungible token balance for the given account, and the attributes. Attributes can be any serializable type. If you don't need attributes, you can pass "empty" in various ways: `&()`, `&Vec::<u8>::new()`, `BoxedBytes::empty()`, etc.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### set_esdt_local_roles
```rust
set_esdt_local_roles(&mut self, address: &Address, token_id: &[u8], roles: &[EsdtLocalRole])
```

Sets the ESDT token roles for the given address and token. Usually used during setup steps.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### set_block_epoch

### set_block_nonce
```rust
et_block_nonce(&mut self, block_nonce: u64)
```

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### set_block_round
```rust
set_block_round(&mut self, block_round: u64)
```

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### set_block_timestamp

```

Set various values for the current block info.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

```

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### set_prev_block_nonce
```rust
set_prev_block_nonce(&mut self, block_nonce: u64)
```

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### set_prev_block_round
```rust
set_prev_block_round(&mut self, block_round: u64)
```

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### set_prev_block_timestamp

set_prev_block_timestamp(&mut self, block_timestamp: u64)
```

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### set_prev_block_random_seed
```rust
set_prev_block_random_seed(&mut self, block_random_seed: Box<[u8; 48]>)
```

Same as the ones above, but sets the block info for the previous block.

## Smart Contract execution functions

These functions help interacting with smart contracts. While they would still fit into the state-altering category, we feel they deserve their own section.  

Note: We will shorten the signatures by not specifying the complete types for the ContractObjWrapper. For reference, the contract wrapper is of type `ContractObjWrapper<CB, ContractObjBuilder>`, where
```rust
    CB: ContractBase<Api = DebugApi> + CallableContract + 'static,
    ContractObjBuilder: 'static + Copy + Fn() -> CB,
```

### execute_tx
```rust
execute_tx(&mut self, caller: &Address, sc_wrapper: &ContractObjWrapper<...>, egld_payment: &num_bigint::BigUint, tx_fn: TxFn) -> TxResult
```

Executes a transaction towards the given SC (defined by the wrapper), with optional EGLD payment (pass 0 if you want no payment). `tx_fn` is a lambda function that accepts a contract object as an argument. For more details about how to write such a lambda, you can take a look at the [Crowdfunding test examples](/developers/developer-reference/rust-testing-framework).  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### execute_esdt_transfer
```rust
execute_esdt_transfer(&mut self, caller: &Address, sc_wrapper: &ContractObjWrapper<...>, token_id: &[u8], esdt_nonce: u64, esdt_amount: &num_bigint::BigUint, tx_fn: TxFn) -> TxResult
```

Same as the function above, but executes an ESDT/NFT transfer instead of EGLD transfer.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### execute_esdt_multi_transfer
```rust
execute_esdt_multi_transfer(&mut self, caller: &Address, sc_wrapper: &ContractObjWrapper<...>, esdt_transfers: &[TxInputESDT], tx_fn: TxFn) -> TxResult
```

Same as the function above, but executes a MultiESDTNFT transfer instead.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### execute_query
```rust
execute_query(&mut self, sc_wrapper: &ContractObjWrapper<...>, query_fn: TxFn) -> TxResult
```

Executes a SCQuery on the SC. None of the changes are commited into the state, but it still needs to be a mutable function to perform the temporary changes. Just like on the real blockchain, there is no caller and no token transfer for queries.  

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### execute_in_managed_environment
```rust
execute_in_managed_environment(&self, f: Func) -> T
```

Executes an arbitrary function and returns its result. The result can be any type. This function is rarely used. It can be useful when you want to perform some checks that involve managed types and such. (since you cannot create managed types outside of the lambda functions).

## Undocumented functions

There are some scenario generation functions that have not been included, but we recommend not bothering with scenario generation. The process is very time-consuming and the results are some unreadable scenario files. If you need to write scenarios, we recommend writing them yourself. If you still want to dabble into the scenario generation, there are some examples in the [Crowdfunding test examples](/developers/developer-reference/rust-testing-framework).
