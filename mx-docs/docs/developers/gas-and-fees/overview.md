[comment]: # (mx-abstract)
The processing cost of a MultiversX transaction is determined by its gas limit, the actual gas consumption, and the gas price per gas unit, leading to a processing fee in EGLD that may be subject to a gas refund in certain cases.

## Cost of processing (gas units)

Each MultiversX transaction has a **processing cost**, expressed as **an amount of _gas units_**. At broadcast time, each transaction must be provided a **gas limit** (`gasLimit`), which acts as an _upper limit_ of the processing cost.

### Constraints

For any transaction, the `gasLimit` must be greater or equal to `erd_min_gas_limit` but smaller or equal to `erd_max_gas_per_transaction`, these two being [parameters of the Network](/sdk-and-tools/rest-api/network#get-network-configuration):

```
networkConfig.erd_min_gas_limit <= tx.gasLimit <= networkConfig.erd_max_gas_per_transaction
```

### Cost components

The **actual gas consumption** - also known as **used gas** - is the consumed amount from the provided **gas limit** - the amount of gas units actually required by the Network in order to process the transaction. The unconsumed amount is called **remaining gas**.

At processing time, the Network breaks the **used gas** down into two components:

- gas used by **value movement and data handling**
- gas used by **contract execution** (for executing System or User-Defined Smart Contract)

:::note
Simple transfers of value (EGLD transfers) only require the _value movement and data handling_ component of the gas usage (that is, no _execution_ gas), while Smart Contract calls require both components of the gas consumption. This includes ESDT and NFT transfers as well, because they are in fact calls to a System Smart Contract.
:::

The **value movement and data handling** cost component is easily computable, using on the following formula:

```
tx.gasLimit =
    networkConfig.erd_min_gas_limit +
    networkConfig.erd_gas_per_data_byte * lengthOf(tx.data)
```

The **contract execution** cost component is easily computable for System Smart Contract calls (based on formulas specific to each contract), but harder to determine _a priori_ for user-defined Smart Contracts. This is where _simulations_ and _estimations_ are employed.

## Processing fee (EGLD)

The **processing fee**, measured in EGLD, is computed with respect to the **actual gas cost** - broken down into its components - and the **gas price per gas unit**, which differs between the components.

The **gas price per gas unit** for the **value movement and data handling** must be specified by the transaction, and it must be equal or greater than a Network parameter called `erd_min_gas_price`.

While the price of a gas unit for the **value movement and data handling** component equals the **gas price** provided in the transaction, the price of a gas unit for the **contract execution** component is computed with respect to another Network parameter called `erd_gas_price_modifier`:

```
value_movement_and_data_handling_price_per_unit = tx.GasPrice
contract_execution_price_per_unit = tx.GasPrice * networkConfig.erd_gas_price_modifier
```

:::note
Generally speaking, the price of a gas unit for **contract execution** is lower than the price of a gas unit for **value movement and data handling**, due to the gas price modifier for contracts (`erd_gas_price_modifier`).
:::

The **processing fee** formula looks like this:

```
processing_fee =
    value_movement_and_data_handling_cost * value_movement_and_data_handling_price_per_unit +
    contract_execution_cost * contract_execution_price_per_unit
```

After processing the transaction, the Network will send a value called **gas refund** back to the sender of the transaction, computed with respect to the unconsumed (component of the) gas, if applicable (if the **paid fee** is higher than the **necessary fee**).
