## MultiversX Smart Contracts

The MultiversX Blockchain's virtual machine (VM) executes [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly). This means that it can execute smart contracts 
written in _any programming language_ that can be compiled to WASM bytecode, such as C, C++, C#, Rust, Go, TypeScript and many others.

Developers are encouraged to use Rust for their smart contracts, however. MultiversX provides a [Rust framework](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-rs) 
which allows for unusually clean and efficient code in smart contracts, a rarity in the blockchain field. 
A declarative testing framework is bundled as well. For the best coding experience, 
developers have the [MultiversX IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Elrond.vscode-elrond-ide) at their disposal.

Navigate through the sidebar to see some tutorials to get you started, as well as the Rust framework documentation.
