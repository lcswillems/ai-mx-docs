Managing Wallets and Addresses

This page summarizes the recommended approach for managing accounts in an application that integrates with the Network.

:::tip
If integrating a **system** with the **Network** involves transfers between different users (accounts) - a good example for this case is the integration between an **exchange system** and the **Network** - the recommended approach is to have **a MultiversX Account (Address) for each user of the system**.
:::

Accounts creation can be achieved through different approaches:

- using the [MultiversX Web Wallet](https://wallet.multiversx.com/)
- programmatically, using the [sdk-js - JavaScript SDK](/sdk-and-tools/sdk-js)
- programmatically, using the [mxpy - Python SDK](/sdk-and-tools/sdk-py/)
- programmatically, using the [erdgo - Golang SDK](/sdk-and-tools/erdgo)
- programmatically, using the [erdjava - Java SDK](/sdk-and-tools/erdjava)
- using the [lightweight CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@multiversx/sdk-wallet-cli)
- using our [lightweight HTTP utility](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-js-wallet-http)
- programmatically, using the [TrustWalletCore extension](https://github.com/trustwallet/wallet-core/tree/master/src/MultiversX) for MultiversX
