## Fields

| Field      | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| address    | The address field holds the address in a bech32 encoding. Should be equal to the _id field.                                                                                          |
| balance    | The balance field holds the amount of EGLD the address possesses. It is a string that also includes the number of decimals. Example: "1500000000000000000" (equivalent to 1.5 EGLD). |
| balanceNum | The balanceNum field holds the amount of EGLD the address possesses, in a numeric format. Example: 1.5.                                                                              |
| nonce      | The nonce field represents the sequence number of the address.                                                                                                                       |
| shardID    | The shardID field represents the shard where the address belongs to, based on its bytes.                                                                                             |
| timestamp  | The timestamp field represents the last moment when the address balance was changed.                                                                                                 |
