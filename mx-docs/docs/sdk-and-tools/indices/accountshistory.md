## Fields

| Field     | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| address   | The address field holds the address in a bech32 encoding.                                                                                                                             |
| balance   | The balance field holds the amount of EGLD the address possesses. It is a string that also includes the number of decimals. Example: "1500000000000000000" (equivalent to 1.5 EGLD).  |
| isSender  | The isSender field is true if the address was the sender when the balance has changed.                                                                                                |
| timestamp | The timestamp field represents the timestamp when the address balance was changed.                                                                                                    |
