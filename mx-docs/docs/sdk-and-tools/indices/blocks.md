## Query examples

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### Fetch blocks for a shard 
In order to fetch the latest blocks from a shard, one has to do a query that matches the field `shardId`.
```
curl --request GET \
  --url ${ES_URL}/blocks/_search \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "query": {
        "match": {
            "shardId": "1"
        }
    },
    "sort": [
        {
            "timestamp": {
                "order": "desc"
            }
        }
    ]
}'
```

### Fetch the latest 10 blocks for all shards

```
curl --request GET \
  --url ${ES_URL}/blocks/_search \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "sort": [
        {
            "timestamp": {
                "order": "desc"
            }
        }
    ],
    "size":10
}'
```
