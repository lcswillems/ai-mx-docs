## _id

The `_id` field for this index is composed of hex-encoded hash of the transaction of the smart contract result that generated the log.

## Fields

| Field          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| address        | The address field holds the address in a bech32 encoding. It can be the address of the smart contract that generated the log or the address of the receiver address of the transaction.                                     |
| events         | The events field holds a list of events.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| originalTxHash | The originalTxHash field holds the hex-encoded hash of the initial transaction. When this field is not empty the log is generated by a smart contract result and this field represents the hash of the initial transaction. |
| timestamp      | The timestamp field represents the timestamp of the block in which the log was generated.                                                                                                                                   |

Event structure 

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| identifier  | This field represents the identifier of the event.                                                                                                                                        |
| address     | The address field holds the address in a bech32 encoding. It can be the address of the smart contract that generated the event or the address of the receiver address of the transaction. |
| topics      | The topics field holds a list with extra information. They don't have a specific order because the smart contract is free to log anything that could be helpful.                          |
| data        | The data field can contain information added by the smart contract that generated the event.                                                                                              |
| order       | The order field represents the index of the event indicating the execution order.                                                                                                         |
