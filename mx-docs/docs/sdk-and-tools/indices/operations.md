[comment]: # (mx-abstract)

This page describes the structure of the `operations` index (Elasticsearch), and also depicts a few examples of how to query it.

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

## _id

The _id field of this index is represented by the transactions OR smart contract result hash, in a hexadecimal encoding.

## Fields

This index contains both transactions and smart contract results. This is useful because one can query both of them in a single request.

The unified structure will contain an extra field in order to be able to differentiate between them.

| Field | Description                                                                                    |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| type  | It can be `normal` in case of a transaction and `unsigned` in case of a smart contract result. |
