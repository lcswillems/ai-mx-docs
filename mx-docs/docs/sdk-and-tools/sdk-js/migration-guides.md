This tutorial will guide you through the process of migrating from one major version of **sdk-js** (or one of its _satellites_) to another.

:::important
Make sure you have a look over the [cookbook](/sdk-and-tools/sdk-js/sdk-js-cookbook), in advance.

## Migrate sdk-wallet  from v2.x to v3 (February of 2023)

See [release notes](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-js-wallet/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

## Migrate erdjs from v9.x to v10 (April of 2022)

**erdjs 10** brought a series of breaking changes. Most importantly, the packages **walletcore**, **dapp**, **contractWrappers** and the network providers (`ApiProvider`, `ProxyProvider`) have been extracted to separate repositories - consequently, they are now distributed as separate NPM packages. **erdjs** does not depend anymore on the libraries **fs**, **crypto** and **axios**.

The classes responsible with parsing contract results or query responses, and the ones responsible with transaction completion detection have been rewritten, as well.

Furthermore, we have removed a couple of _previously-thought as utility_ functions, in order to simplify and improve the codebase of **erdjs**.

### Balance vs. TokenPayment

In erdjs 10, the classes `Balance` and `BalanceBuilder` do not exist anymore.

Instead, a `TokenPayment` or an `IAccountBalance` (a simple `BigNumber`) should be used instead, depending on the case.

erdjs 9x:

```
let balance = Balance.egld(1);
```

erdjs 10:

```
let paymentEGLD = TokenPayment.egldFromAmount("1");
let paymentFungible = TokenPayment.fungibleFromBigInteger(identifier, "1000000", numDecimals);
let paymentNonFungible = TokenPayment.nonFungible(identifier, nonce);
```

### Transaction broadcasting and fetching

The following utility functions are not available anymore: `transaction.send()`, `transaction.getAsOnNetwork()`.

Instead, one should directly call a network provider:

```
await networkProvider.sendTransaction(tx);
await networkProvider.getTransaction(txHash)
```

### Transaction awaiting

In erdjs 10, the following utility functions are not available anymore: `transaction.awaitExecuted()`, `transaction.awaitPending()`.

Instead, one should directly use the `TransactionWatcher`:

```
let transactionWatcher = new TransactionWatcher(networkProvider);
await watcher.awaitCompleted(tx);
```

### Fetching network configuration

In erdjs 10, we have removed the utility functions `NetworkConfig.getDefault()` and `NetworkConfig.sync()`. 

Instead, one should fetch the network configuration as follows: 

```
let networkConfig = await provider.getNetworkConfig();
```

Then cache the response, if needed.

### Nonce, gas limit, gas price, chain ID

In erdjs 10, the classes `Nonce`, `GasLimit`, `GasPrice` and `ChainID` do not exist anymore. 

Instead, one should simply use primitives when creating transactions / interactions:

```
let tx = new Transaction({
    nonce: 7,
    data: new TransactionPayload("helloWorld"),
    gasLimit: 70000,
    gasPrice: 1000000000,
    receiver: new Address("erd1..."),
    value: TokenPayment.egldFromAmount(1),
    chainID: "D"
});
```

### Creating contract queries

The function `smartContract.runQuery()` has been removed, in order to decouple the `SmartContract` class from the network provider.

In erdjs 10, one should do as follows:

```
let query = smartContract.createQuery({ /* ... */ });
let queryResponse = await networkProvider.queryContract(query);
```

 `smartContract.createQuery()` + `provider.queryContract()` have to be used, instead.

### Creating interactions using "contract.methods"

In erdjs 10, when using `contract.methods.myContractFunction([a, b, c])`, the type inference system comes into play. 

That is, you **cannot** write the following anymore:

```
let interaction = <Interaction>this.contract.methods.getLotteryInfo([
    BytesValue.fromUTF8("my-lottery")
]);
```

Instead, you have to either **not provide typed values** ar arguments (automatic type inference will be applied):

```
let interaction = <Interaction>this.contract.methods.getLotteryInfo(["my-lottery")]);
```

 \- or to provide typed values, as before, but using the `methodsExplicit` object:

```
let interaction = <Interaction>this.contract.methodsExplicit.getLotteryInfo([
    BytesValue.fromUTF8("my-lottery")
]);
```

### Parsing contract results

The modules designed to parse the contract results have been rewritten in erdjs 10. `ExecutionResultsBundle` and `QueryResponseBundle` have been removed, and replaced by `TypedOutcomeBundle` (and its untyped counterpart, `UntypedOutcomeBundle`).  `SmartContractResults` has been changed to not use the concepts `immediate result` and `resulting calls` anymore. Instead, interpreting `SmartContractResults.items` is now the responsibility of the `ResultsParser`. `interpretQueryResponse()` and `interpretExecutionResults()` do not exist on the `Interaction` object anymore. `DefaultInteractionRunner` has been removed, as well.

The functions `getReceipt()`, `getSmartContractResults()` and `getLogs()` of `TransactionOnNetwork` have been removed. The underlying properties are now public. Furthermore, `TransactionOnNetwork` is now defined within `@multiversx/sdk-network-providers`.

In order to parse contract results in erdjs 10, please follow [this guide](/sdk-and-tools/sdk-js/sdk-js-cookbook#parsing-contract-results).

### `EsdtHelpers` and `ScArgumentsParser` vs. `transaction-decoder`

In erdjs 10, the classes `EsdtHelpers` and `ScArgumentsParser` have been removed.

Instead, one should reference and use the package [@multiversx/sdk-transaction-decoder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@multiversx/sdk-transaction-decoder).

### ChainID is now required

`ChainID` is now a required parameter of the `Transaction` constructor. 

Furthermore, `interaction.withChainID("D")` must be used before calling `interaction.buildTransaction()`.

```
let tx = interaction
    .withNonce(7)
    .withGasLimit(20000000)
    .withChainID("D")
    .buildTransaction();
```
