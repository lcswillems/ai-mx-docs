mxpy (Command Line Interface)

**mxpy**, as a command-line tool, can be used to simplify and automate the interaction with the MultiversX network - it can be easily used in shell scripts, as well. It implements a set of **commands**, organized within **groups**. 

The complete Command Line Interface is listed [here](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-py-cli/blob/main/CLI.md). Command usage and description are available through the `--help` flags.

For example:

```
mxpy --help
mxpy tx --help
mxpy tx new --help
```
