MultiversX provides scripts designed to streamline the process of installing a MultiversX node. This validator script is a general script for accessing the Mainnet, Devnet and Testnet networks.

To get started, you will begin by getting a copy of the latest version of the scripts from Github and configure it to match your local setup.

:::caution
Nodes scripts should not be run as a root user. Such usage is not supported and may result in unexpected behavior.

## **Download the MultiversX Scripts**

```

## **Configure the scripts correctly**

The scripts require a few configurations to be set in order to work correctly.

First and foremost, you need your exact username on your local machine. You can find out your current username by running the `whoami` command, which will print it out:

```bash
whoami
```

Next, in the `variables.cfg` file, edit and add your username in the following variables:

- `ENVIRONMENT`: The MultiversX network to be used: mainnet, testnet or devnet.
- `CUSTOM_HOME`: This refers to the folder on the computer in which you will install your node.
- `CUSTOM_USER`: which is the username on the computer under which you will run the installation, upgrade, and other processes

Open `variables.cfg` in the `nano` editor:

```bash
cd ~/mx-chain-scripts/config
nano variables.cfg
```

Change the variables `ENVIRONMENT`, `CUSTOM_HOME` and `CUSTOM_USER` as highlighted in the image below:

For `CUSTOM_USER` variable, use the output of the `whoami` command that was run earlier.

Save the file and exit:

- If you’re editing with **nano**, press `Ctrl+X`, then `y`, and `Enter`
- If you’re editing with **vi** or **vim**, hold down `Shift` and press `z` twice.

## **Ensure user privileges**

Ensure your user has `sudo` enabled and accessible so that it doesn't ask for a password every time it executes something.

If you are certain this is already done, feel free to skip forward. Otherwise, you will need to add your username to a special list.

So let's add it to the overrides:

```bash
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/myOverrides
```

Now, navigate to the end of the file by pressing `Shift + G`. Next, press `o` to add a new line, and type the following, replacing `username` with the output of the `whoami` command that was run earlier.

```bash
yourusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

Conclude by pressing `Esc`, then save and close the file by holding down `Shift` while pressing `z` twice.

Your user should now be able to execute `sudo` commands.
